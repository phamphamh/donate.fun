# Donate.fun - Blockchain-Powered Transparent Donations

*Built in 36 hours for the BSA Privacy x Verifiability Hackathon 2025*

## Reimagining Charitable Giving with Blockchain

Donate.fun is a next-generation donation platform that leverages blockchain technology to create a more transparent, efficient, fair, and secure financial system for charitable giving. We're revolutionizing how people donate by ensuring funds reach their intended recipients with full accountability at every step.

### The Problem We're Solving

Traditional non-governmental organizations (NGOs) play a vital role in connecting donors with causes, but face significant challenges:

- **Fund Misappropriation**: Cases like the Red Cross losing over â‚¬5 million meant for fighting Ebola in West Africa (2014-2016) demonstrate the risk of embezzlement
- **High Overhead Costs**: 10-30% of donations typically go to administrative costs rather than direct aid
- **Lack of Transparency**: 87% of regular donors want information about how their donations are used, but often can't track funds
- **Indirect Aid**: Traditional systems make it difficult to provide direct peer-to-peer assistance
- **Complex Fund Tracking**: Following how donations are spent is difficult or impossible
- **Privacy Concerns**: Donors may want anonymity options that traditional systems don't provide

### Our Solution

Donate.fun uses blockchain technology to address these challenges:

- **Complete Transparency**: Every transaction is recorded on a public blockchain, allowing donors to track exactly where their money goes
- **Checkpoint Validation**: Funds are released in stages when recipients provide proof that they're using funds as intended
- **Direct Impact**: Connect donors directly with recipients, minimizing intermediaries
- **Lower Overhead**: Streamlined processes reduce administrative costs
- **Community Verification**: Donors collectively validate proofs provided by recipients
- **Optional Anonymity**: Privacy-preserving features for donors who prefer to remain anonymous
- **Smart Contract Security**: Code-enforced rules ensure funds are only released when conditions are met

## How It Works

1. **Project Creation**: Organizations or individuals create projects with clear goals, funding targets, and checkpoints
2. **Donation Collection**: Donors contribute to projects they care about using cryptocurrency
3. **Checkpoint System**: Recipients must provide proof of progress to unlock portions of funding
4. **Consensus Validation**: The donor community votes to approve evidence before funds are released
5. **Complete Tracking**: Donors can follow their contributions from start to finish

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js Frontend**: Modern, responsive user interface built with React and Next.js
- **Privy Login**: Seamless onboarding for users new to blockchain
- **Decentralized Identity (DID)**: Ensures one-person-one-account verification
- **Smart Contracts**: Secure, automated enforcement of funding terms
- **Vesting System**: Progressive fund release based on milestone completion
- **Proof of Action (PoA)**: Recipients upload images, videos, and documents to prove appropriate use of funds
- **Donor Consensus**: Democratic verification system for proof validation
- **Hedera Blockchain**: Fast, eco-friendly foundation for all transactions

## Market Potential

While precise 2024 figures aren't yet available, the charitable giving market is substantial. In Switzerland alone, donations to aid organizations totaled 2.25 billion francs in 2023. Globally, the charitable donation market is estimated at several hundred billion dollars annually.
